git clone https://github.com/Abdulkareemoj/Strmr.git
cd Strmr
```

Install dependencies

## Set up with Supabase

- Create a new project on [Supabase](https://supabase.io/)
- The project already has a `.env.example` file. Rename it to `.env.local` and fill in the required details from your Supabase project.
- To make it easier if youre deploying on vercel, you can use the supabase vercel integration to automatically set up the environment variables for you.
- However to get the supabase url and key, you can find them in the settings of your supabase project.
- The other values are also on the dashboard but will take a little bit of searching to find them.
- When you find the rest of the environment variables run the following commands to set up the database schema and seed the database with some data:

```bash
npx prisma generate ##To generate the prisma client
npx prisma db push ##To push the schema to the database

```
