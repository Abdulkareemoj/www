This repository is a template for creating a full-stack application using Node.js, React, TypeScript, and Docker. It provides a minimal setup for both the frontend and backend, containerized using Docker, to help you get started quickly.

## Features

- **Frontend**: Built with React and TypeScript, bundled using Vite for fast development.
- **Backend**: RESTful API built with Node.js, TypeScript, Express, and Mongoose.
- **Docker**: Containerized setup for both frontend and backend to ensure consistent environments across different setups.
- **Linting**: ESLint configuration for TypeScript and React to maintain code quality.
